Cooque
=====
**Cooque** is a voice-controlled recipe book app.

Description
-----
Sometimes when people cook, their hands become really greasy and they do not want to touch their phone screen to look at the recipe.
Cooque solves this problem by allowing people to use voice to control the recipe book. 
It has several commands: "START" - the app starts to read the first line of the recipe; "NEXT" - the app reads the next line of recipe; "PREVIOUS" - the app goes back and reads the previous line of recipe; "REPEAT" - the app repeats the same line of recipe; "OK COOQUE" - the app tells the user it is listening (kind of imitates Google's "OK GOOGLE"); "STOP LISTENING" - the app stops listening.
